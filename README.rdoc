== Synchronizer

This app is made for participation in Ukrainian Web Challenge 2012.
It allows users to link their social networks and cloud file storages (such as Dropbox).
After that users can
1) synchronize avatars to cloud file storages;
2) synchronize gists from Github to cloud file storages;
3) synchronize profile data between those social networks that allow it (via their API).
